# FlowFinder

FlowFinder is a web application built with Python and Flask, utilizing the Spotipy library to interact with the Spotify Web API. It provides users with insights into their Spotify usage, displaying basic statistics such as recently played songs, top tracks, top artists, and profile interactions. Additionally, users can create playlists based on their recently played tracks, custom recommendations generated by Spotify's algorithm, top tracks, and genres.
